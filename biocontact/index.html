<p><strong>Bio:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hi, I am Yohan </strong>and I am a French & English-speaking actor and voice-over artist currently based in Paris, France (during Covid times).</p>
<p><strong>I like to make my life simple.</strong> I like to deal with things one step at a time. I have a pretty clear picture of what I want to achieve in life. I like to be on stage in front of a big audience, which could be performing in a big theatre, or presenting a TED talk about the power of your mind!</p>
<p><strong>My dream apartment</strong> is a minimally furnished penthouse of a small building, with floor to ceiling windows and a grand piano facing the beautiful view of <em>[insert city name here]</em>. And you’re invited, of course.</p>
<p><strong>I value work</strong> + having free time to enjoy simple things, like cooking, taking naps, looking at trees, talking over a cup of tea, or over quality food and a glass of wine. I like to own a small number of things.</p>
<p><strong>I act.</strong> I picture myself doing it most of the time + <strong>doing business creatively</strong> the other part of the time. I am straightforward and diplomatic in my way of communicating. I adore Hugo Boss. I rarely buy Hugo Boss.</p>
<p><strong>I enjoy conveying one meaningful message at a time.</strong> I seek balance, fairness and peace. I am a good adviser. I am good at impersonating locals, organizing, following my intuition and playing the piano.</p>
<p><strong>I like healthy food and clean counters.</strong> I strive to experience the greater and uplifting spheres of society while staying in sync with my values and principles. I like Charlize Theron, Joe Hisaishi, Hayao Miyasaki, Tilda Swinton, Ralph Fiennes and Stanley Tucci <em>[to name a few]</em>. I cried watching The Last 5 Years, Billy Elliot, Rent, The Imitation Game, Black Swan, Big Fish and Spirited Away <em>[to name a few]</em>. I like nature. I love my family. I love love.</p>
<p><strong>I love achieving things.</strong> I work effectively standing up and with deadlines. I take pleasure in taking days off from technology. I like the Japanese culture. I won an award for performing the role of a sadistic psychopath, and now you’re slightly backing off from the screen! Rest assured, I love Disney.</p>
<p><strong>I value communication.</strong> I love re-reading what I wrote a year ago. I will make a great James Bond villain. I like change. I love life.</p>
<hr><p><strong>For a more formal version of myself:</strong> I am a graduate from the Lee Strasberg Theatre & Film Institute in New York, I have a Master’s Degree in Quantification of Financial Risks from Paris Dauphine University, I am a graduate from “Le Wagon”, a computer programming intensive based in Paris, I won the award for “Best Monologue” at the Winter Film Awards in 2012, I have been a contestant on “Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?”, “The Weakest Link” & “1 vs 100”. One of my absolute dreams would be to play “Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?”.</p>
