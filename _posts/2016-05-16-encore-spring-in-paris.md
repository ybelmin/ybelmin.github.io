Hey everyone,

Hope you&#8217;re doing well and enjoying the warmer days.

I&#8217;m still back home, finishing <a href="https://www.lewagon.com/" target="_blank">Le Wagon</a> in 3 weeks. As a final project, 2 of my fellow students and I will be creating a **web app themed around the Paleo Diet**. More about it once it&#8217;s in the making.

But on the subject of dietary lifestyles, I really want to share <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nadkmy4nE_c" target="_blank">a video of a constructive debate around food</a> that I find really enlightening. It&#8217;s, to me, one of those rare valuable videos you can find on the Internet. It is a perfect example that food works differently on different people.

Sending you much love and talk to you soon,

-Yohan
