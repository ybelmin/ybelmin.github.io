Dear friends,

I&#8217;m loving Paris for another month before coming back to NY on March 1st. It would have been the longest time I&#8217;ve spent back home in 5 years, and it just feels right.

I&#8217;m glad to share that the movie **ALLURE directed by Vladan Nikolic**, in which I appear, will be <a href="http://www.allurethefilm.com/" target="_blank"><strong>opening in NY on March 6 at the Quad Cinema</strong></a>, and will run until March 12. I will of course be present and I want you to go see it too! I mean, you have the choice, but that&#8217;d be very honorable of you to do so ;)

Finally, this month, I&#8217;d like to recommend to you an inspiring **speech coach**. It&#8217;s **Monica Blaze Leavitt**. She has been teaching voice, diction and accent reduction for almost 20 years, and has made my speech improve incredibly ever since we started working together. <a href="http://theprofessionalimpact.com/monica-blaze-leavitt/" target="_blank"><strong>Here&#8217;s more about her</strong></a>, and you should definitely check her out!

Be well and see you soon!
