Hi everyone,

I&#8217;m looking for a job!

I&#8217;m back in NY after completing <a href="https://www.lewagon.com/" target="_blank">&#8220;Le Wagon&#8221;</a> in Paris, and I&#8217;m a looking for a position as a **&#8220;Junior Full Stack Ruby Developer&#8221;**. **If you happen to know of a company (or a team) **looking for an extra pair of hands in the web development world, **please shoot me a message**, it would help me tremendously and it would mean the world to me! <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ybelmin" target="_blank"><strong>I&#8217;ve revamped my LinkedIn Profile</strong></a> where everything is nicely presented and explained!

It&#8217;s an exciting transition, I came to realize over the years that there is more to me than solely an artistic career, I&#8217;ve always loved (and still love) mathematics and I truly intend to make the most of it! I&#8217;m excited to see what this mix of art and science will lead up to!

I&#8217;m sending you much love, I hope all is well with you and thank you again for reading,

-Yohan
