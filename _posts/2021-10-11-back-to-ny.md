How is life? (I was tempted to create a survey with two possible choices: a) "Good, actually!" or b) "Duh...".)

On my end, and I believe for a lot of people too, a lot has happened since I wrote in June. Let's be honest: after doing a 2-week quarantine in Mexico in September, I managed to make it back to Texas to reunite with my partner, only to witness the relationship end quite quickly and move back to France. It's sad, for sure, but I can't help to see some humour in it too considering what 2020 has been in general + the fact that after re-reading my journal, my new year resolution for last year was to "travel and be more adventurous"! Hey, at least I am a man of my word ;)

Now for the (much) better part:

**1)** I added a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.yohanbelmin.com/voiceover/" target="">**dedicated voice-over page**</a> on my website, and uploaded 3 VO demos.<br>
**2)** I now have a home studio set-up to record VO work.<br>
**3)** And, I am now SAG-AFTRA Eligible thanks to a voice-over I recorded last year!

I am thinking of you all, I hope you are well, and I am sending the brightest vibes your way.

How is life? (for real.) I'd love to hear from you.

Much love,

-Yohan
