Dear friends,

Things are going well, slowly and surely.

My visa renewal got approved and I just got back to New York. Three more years of being able to work here is always a pretty cool and relieving news to get, believe me! Thanks again to everyone who helped me in the process, it means a whole lot to me.Â And I&#8217;m entering a bit of a transitional year as well so that&#8217;s going to be interesting to follow too.

Finally, I want to say a huge congrats to Caycee Black and Jeffrey Turboff <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BAoP3LYBHLs/" target="_blank">for their win</a> at the Macabre Faire Film Festival for &#8220;Jimbo&#8221;, you go guys! ;)

Much love and talk to you soon.
