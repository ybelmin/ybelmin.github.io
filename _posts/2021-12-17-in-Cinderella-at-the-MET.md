Happy holidays to you, wherever you are in the world!

A very quick update to let you know that I am reprising the role of the "Herald" this holiday season in a new 95-minute & English version of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.metopera.org/season/2021-22-season/cinderella/" target="">**"Cinderella"**</a> by Jules Massenet, at the Metropolitan Opera. The show opens tonight, and will run until January 3, 2022.

My new Visa application has also been submitted yesterday, so hopefully I will get approved on time to be able to finish the run. I can't remember ever asking for a Christmas / Hanukkah miracle, but today's the day!

Wishing you all the best for this end of the year. I hope you are doing wonderfully well.

Much love, as always,

-Yohan
