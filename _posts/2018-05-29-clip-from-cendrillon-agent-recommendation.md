Hi Everyone,

As you probably know, I had the chance to be part of the production of &#8220;Cendrillon&#8221; at the MET which closed on May 11. If you didn&#8217;t manage to see it, either at the opera or at the movies, I wanted to share with you <a href="https://vimeo.com/270187477" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>the clip of my appearance as the King&#8217;s Herald</strong></a>!

I am also now **looking to be represented by an agent**. If you happen to know a good one and are willing to introduce me to him/her, please shoot me an email, it would mean the world to me. I&#8217;ve realized over the years that all the best projects I&#8217;ve had the chance to be a part of have been the result of someone kind enough to recommend me. I believe it can be done again, and what goes around comes around!

Finally if you&#8217;re in NY tonight, check out **Christian Felix&#8217;s and Shonali Bhowmik&#8217;s live podcast show <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/191127731610312/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;We Don&#8217;t Even Know&#8221;</a> at 8pm at Red Room**, they&#8217;ve been working hard at it for years! Tonight&#8217;s guests are actor-comedian-writer Jon Benjamin (Bob&#8217;s Burgers, Archer), cartoonist-writer-performer Emily Flake Pastore and songwriter-musician Rob Townsend.

Much love,

-Yohan
