Here&#8217;s a little update from me since last January:&nbsp;

1) Here&#8217;s a&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://vimeo.com/322529496" target="_blank">clip of my performance</a>&nbsp;in &#8220;La Fille du RÃ©giment&#8221; @ the Met;&nbsp;
2) Here is a fun&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://vimeo.com/322531429" target="_blank">time-lapse of the make-up process</a>&nbsp;to age me for the role of the Notary;
3) +&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://operawire.com/metropolitan-opera-2018-19-review-la-fille-du-regiment/" target="_blank">my name was mentioned in a review</a>&nbsp;of the opera!

Finally, I&#8217;d like to give a shout-out to my good friend, former roommate AND former finalist of the Voice Switzerland, Rahel Buchhold. Alongside&nbsp;Rose Clark, they released&nbsp;their first EP&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/0R7LNvkzHdOvgzna8EEthI" target="_blank"><em>Blue Desert&nbsp;</em>on Spotify as the duet &#8220;Rahel n&#8217; Rose&#8221;.</a>

Here&#8217;s to Spring everyone, hope you&#8217;re doing well!

Much love,

-Yohan
