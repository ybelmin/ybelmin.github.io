Dear friends,

In a career like acting, it always comes down to &#8220;How bad do you want it?&#8221; and personally, I am afraid of taking risks, rejection and failure. Seems like I&#8217;m hitting a wall here, aren&#8217;t I! Well, I&#8217;ve decided to change that.

In January, I started an 8-week course about how to change your way of thinking, and take action in order to accomplish a specific goal. So for this month I will very humbly be your guinea pig! My goal is (and I&#8217;m aiming high on purpose) to book a recurring guest star role in a successful TV Series.

So stay tuned next month for an (entertaining?) report about my accomplishments, and hopefully my many failures towards my goal! &#8220;Don&#8217;t be trapped by dogma &#8211; which is living with the results of other people&#8217;s thinking. Your time is limited, so don&#8217;t waste it living someone else&#8217;s life.&#8221; &#8211; Steve Jobs. :-)

Be well!
