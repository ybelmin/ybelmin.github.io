Dear friends,

I&#8217;ve never asked for help via this newsletter, but here it is, I have faith something good will come out of it.

I&#8217;m renewing my work Visa for 3 more years. If anyone can & is willing to:
**   => **include me in a **<u>potential</u>** project between now and late 2018;
**   => **employ me on an **<u>ongoing</u>** basis;
**   => **or **<u>feature</u>** me in an article or blog;
I&#8217;d be forever grateful. I now more than ever need all the love I can get.

I hope you&#8217;re well and you had an amazing summer,

Much love.
