Dear friends,

I hope you enjoyed the holidays and you are as excited as I am about going back on track!

I took advantage of these past quiet weeks to edit my very first demo reel! Go <a href="https://vimeo.com/136450987" target="_blank">take a look at it</a> and share it as much as you like, it really does help!

Finally, happy Epiphany! You thought the festivities were over, but there is one last cake we (ze French) want you to endure before starting your new &#8220;I am going to work out more in 2014&#8221; resolution! If you happen to be around, <a href="http://nymag.com/nymetro/food/features/10777/" target="_blank">here is where</a> you can buy your &#8220;Galette des Rois&#8221; in New York ;-)

Be well and happy new year!
