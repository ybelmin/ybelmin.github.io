Dear friends,

I stuck to it. I set myself a three-month goal, and the result is here.

I&#8217;m proud, happy and relieved (not gonna lie!) to present to you MyActorTemplate.com (UPDATE: It&#8217;s on hold, the business model wasn&#8217;t working, I have a new idea in mind). This officially makes me an actor who creates websites for actors, and I like the idea of it! I put a lot of thought and work into it, so feel free to spread the love!

And of course, who isn&#8217;t behind Cumberbatch for the Oscars &#8211; if you haven&#8217;t seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5CjKEFb-sM&safe=active" target="_blank">The Imitation Game</a>, you should probably run for your life and see it.

Happy holidays!
