Dear friends,

What a cool thing it is to notice progress in your everyday life, things don&#8217;t always go smoothly but knowing you&#8217;re going in the right direction makes it exciting to keep rolling and see what&#8217;s going to happen!

I recently took new headshots and they are pretty awesome. It&#8217;s all thanks to the amazing work of Dave Thomas Brown. Feel free to take a look at them [here](http://www.yohanbelmin.com/photos/).

Finally, I&#8217;d like to recommend to you a very compelling <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-science-of-getting-rich/?dtcode=aowePVc1G1oP" target="_blank">online course</a> on the book &#8220;The Science of Getting Rich&#8221; by Wallace D. Wattle. Don&#8217;t be fooled by the title, it has much more knowledge to it than what the simplistic headline could imply. And please don&#8217;t pay the full price, search Google for a <a href="http://www.retailmenot.com/view/udemy.com?c=6240502" target="_blank">coupon</a> ;)

Be well!
