Dear friends,

Just a quick email from me, as this new month begins.

I&#8217;m glad to say that I started **freelancing** with Sandy Gunar from **Avanti Talent Management**. Still moving forward and getting better exposure, one step at a time.

And most importantly my roommate **Joseph Spinelli** will be singing at **Joe&#8217;s Pub** on Sunday night as part of <a href="http://www.playbill.com/news/article/anthony-rapp-will-get-back-to-paying-the-rent-this-month-345879#.VR7Pas_XE8A.facebook" target="_blank">Paying the RENT!</a> with **Anthony Rapp** and other great Broadway names. This concert will be a fundraising for their upcoming production of RENT at the **2015 Edinburgh Fringe**. Promo code for Sunday is **RENT12**. You&#8217;re welcome ;)

Be well and see you soon!
