First and foremost, of course, happy new year for the 1000th time ;) I don&#8217;t know about you but I have a good feeling about this one, as I had with 2014, 2013 and 2011. (2012 was such a bummer, wasn&#8217;t it?)

This January celebrates my 5-year anniversary in New York, and what a better place to celebrate it than&#8230; Paris. &#8220;Whaaat?&#8221; do I already hear in the audience? Yes (and for the love of me please sit down) I&#8217;ve decided to extend my stay to spend some quality time with my beloved ones + start building the foundations of my acting career &#8220;en fran√ßais&#8221; as well. I have a good feeling about this, as I had with&#8230; ok, ok, I get it.
