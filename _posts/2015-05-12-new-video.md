Dear friends,

Great things happening, once again, slowly but surely.

Check out <a href="https://vimeo.com/125959966" target="_blank"><strong>one of the readings</strong></a> I did for Meghan Rafferty, as part of a 4-week class I took with her.

And if you can, I highly recommend seeing <a href="http://labtheater.org/events/nice-girl/" target="_blank"><strong>&#8220;Nice Girl&#8221;</strong></a> at **the Labyrinth Theater**. There&#8217;s nothing like witnessing great acting on stage.

Enjoy Spring!
