I hope you are finding the time to relax a little this summer (at the very least in spirit!)

After 12 formative years in NY, I have decided to move my home base to Paris, this October 1st. Priorities change over time and it now makes much more sense to me to be closer to my family. It has obviously been an unbelievable learning experience: I immersed myself in a new culture, I perfected a new language & I established myself as an artist. 

Being an immigrant made me more compassionate, and made me realize over the years that the country that I originally wanted to distance myself from, was bloody damn nice (pardon my Flemish): It's beautiful, I speak the language, I can apply to any job that I want, I eat well, I drink well and I can complain and be accepted ;) *(by the way, I'm copyrighting the next self-help book about the "Power of Complaining": it will be useless <u>AND</u> a NYTimes Best Seller.)* In all seriousness, France is home for me, and I am now ready to try home. And I still keep my US Artist Visa for potential work overseas. I will however now refuse my Green Card if I get it late September as I no longer seek permanent residency (the irony of it all!)

But enough with me, how are you?

Much love, as always, and be merry!
