Dear friends,

It&#8217;s sunny, it&#8217;s warm and that&#8217;s all I was asking for. Now let&#8217;s make the most of it, shall we?

I have updated new videos of readings I did for several Casting Directors. They showcase me pretty well, take a look at them [here](http://yohanbelmin.com/media/)!

And I&#8217;d like to share an awesome tool: <a href="http://bananatag.com/" target="_blank">Bananatag</a>. It tracks important emails you send and lets you know when they were opened and if any of your links were clicked. It&#8217;s so easy, just enjoy.

Be well!
