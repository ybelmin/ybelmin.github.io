Dear friends,

I hope you had the chance to take a well-deserved break in August and that you are all fresh and ready to take &#8220;September&#8221; by the horns!

I&#8217;ve spent my summer re-assessing my wants and my needs about my life and career goals. I has been a very enlightening process and, yes, one hell of a mental ride! Conclusion? I have an office and I&#8217;m creating my first business on top of a very specific vision I now have for my acting career. More about it next month!

Finally, I&#8217;d like to recommend to you a classic, if not the reference, in terms of personal development and self-help book: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Think-Grow-Rich-Napoleon-Hill/dp/1604591870/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1409674787&sr=1-3&keywords=think+and+grow+rich" target="_blank">&#8220;Think and Grow Rich&#8221;</a> by Napoleon Hill. As with everything, it&#8217;s not for everyone, but I believe it&#8217;s a least worth peeking into it.

Be well, and let&#8217;s get to work!
