Dear friends,

Spring has arrived, so I&#8217;ll celebrate by making this message short and sweet!

Tomorrow Wednesday April 16 at 7pm, I will be &#8220;exploring&#8221; on stage the American adaptation of the play &#8220;Shoot The Freak&#8221; as part of the Drama League &#8216;Rough Draft Residency&#8217;. Feel free to come <a href="http://dramaleague.thankyou4caring.org/NonMember#shoot" target="_blank">check it out</a>!

Finally, I&#8217;d like to give (another!) huge shout-out to my friend Rahel Buchhold who made it to the final round of The Voice in the Switzerland! Check out one of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX7MFYXcPDM" target="_blank">her duets here</a> (she&#8217;s on the left), Rahel for the win!

Be well!
