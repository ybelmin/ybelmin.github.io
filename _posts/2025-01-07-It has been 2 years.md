It has been 2 years. Two years since I posted on this blog. I wasn't prepared to write anything, really. I almost felt compelled to write a "Previously on _**My Blog**_", but thought it would have been too much of Me Me Me, in an email that is already about Me Me Me.

I have been rediscovering my life back home in France & realized it was sort of inevitable to have to start a little bit from scratch acting-wise. It was expected after all, I had moved back to be closer to my family knowing I would have to adjust professionally. And it has been just that. But now, I feel more compelled to come out of my shell and start reconnecting with the world!

Since being back, I had a role on French TV, I acted in several short films, I continued recording voice-overs (I even was the French voice of Oscar ISAAC for a commercial) and I have been sending quite the pile of individual e-mails to people in the acting world stating that I exist. Good news: it appears I do. But it also appears I am not the only one doing it ðŸ˜‰

Anyway, happy to be back. If you are interested in what's been new, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://linktr.ee/yohanbelmin" target="_blank" style="color: #0000EE;">**my Linktree page** (_https://linktr.ee/yohanbelmin_)</a> would be a great place to start.

How have you been?

As always, lots of love, and of course, a happy happy (happy) new year,

-Yohan
