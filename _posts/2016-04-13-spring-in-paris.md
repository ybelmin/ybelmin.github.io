Hey everyone,

Guess what, **I&#8217;m back home for Spring** for the first time in 6 years. And I know this comes as a relief to you as you were probably wondering day and night about where I was ;)

I actually decided to come back to follow a **9-week computer programming course in Paris** called <a href="https://www.lewagon.com/" target="_blank">Le Wagon</a>. Why? Because I&#8217;ve always liked it, and I want to add a more **rational set of skills to my career**. Also I get to spend time with my family and eat my Mom&#8217;s cooking for a while, not gonna lie!

And while I&#8217;m here, **Flo Ankah** is preparing her very French <a href="http://www.broadwayworld.com/cabaret/article/French-Singer-Floanne-to-Bring-APRIL-IN-PARIS-to-Feinsteins54-Below-20160407" target="_blank">&#8220;April in Paris&#8221;</a> concert at **Feinstein&#8217;s/54 Below** on April 22. Go support her and get a taste of Parisian Spring in NY!

Much love and talk to you soon,

-Yohan
