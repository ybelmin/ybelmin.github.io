Dear friends,

So what&#8217;s new you are (not) asking me? ;-)

I have recorded a voice-over in French for Adidas this past month. Come <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXMErJpxYQ" target="_blank">take a look</a> at the commercial on Youtube!

And if you haven&#8217;t already, go see <a href="http://blog.3ldnyc.org/post/70512249867/deepest-man-written-by-james-scruggs-directed-by" target="_blank">&#8220;Deepest Man&#8221;</a> at the 3LD Theatre. It&#8217;s a holographic play about Hurricane Katrina. It runs until June 14, it is a &#8220;visual marvel&#8221; according to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/31/theater/in-deepest-man-an-immersion-into-a-watery-beyond.html?_r=0" target="_blank">the NYTimes</a> and my talented friend Miguel Reis is in it!

Be well!
