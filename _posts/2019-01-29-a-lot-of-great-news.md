Hi everyone,

After spending 2 months on finalizing the renewal of my work Visa, and waiting on the answer, I can now focus on sharing all the good news:

1) My&nbsp;**work visa**&nbsp;got renewed for 3 more years.
2) An&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/rrcqlkbkqtltqxf/Journal%20du%20Vesinet.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank"><strong>article was published</strong></a>&nbsp;about my recent work at the MET in &#8220;Le Journal du Vésinet&#8221;, the magazine of my hometown.
3) I voiced a French crow in the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4laullxBFs" target="_blank"><strong>&#8220;Brawl Stars&#8221; game app commercial</strong></a>.
4) And finally,&nbsp;**I got cast once again**&nbsp;**at The Metropolitan Opera, this time in&nbsp;**<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.metopera.org/season/2018-19-season/la-fille-du-regiment/" target="_blank"><em><strong>La Fille du Régiment</strong></em></a>, in which I will be playing the role of the Notary starting Feb 7, opposite Kathleen Turner!
