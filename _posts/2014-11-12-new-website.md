Dear friends,

I have been working hard this month, despite what my inner little New York voice is trying to tell me!

My new website is on (UPDATE: I was talking about theÂ previous one!) I would love to hear your feedback, it&#8217;d help me make it even better, for me, and soon for others (hint hint) ;-)

Finally, and this might be the first time I&#8217;m recommending a book before actually devouring it, my instinct tells me that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Powers-Two-Finding-Innovation-Creative/dp/0544031598" target="_blank">this book</a> is going to be a game-changing read.

Stay warm!
