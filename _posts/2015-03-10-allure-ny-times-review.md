Dear friends,

I&#8217;m back in NY. It&#8217;s warm. It&#8217;s nice.

The movie **ALLURE directed by Vladan Nikolic**, in which I appear, got a pretty cool <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/07/movies/review-vladan-nikolics-allure-shows-new-york-through-immigrants-eyes.html?_r=0" target="_blank"><strong>NY Times review</strong></a>, check it out. It is still screening **at the Quad Cinema** until this Thursday March 12.

Also <a href="http://www.moma.org/visit/calendar/exhibitions/1501" target="_blank"><strong>Björk&#8217;s exhibit at MoMA</strong></a> opened this week, time to get out of your comfort zone ;)

Be well and see you soon!
