First of all, I hope you are doing well wherever you are in these unique times. I am currently back home in France waiting for the US border to reopen (at some point). I realize I haven't sent any update in 10 months, but who said a newsletter had to be written more often than that!

Some recent news to share:

1) **La Fille Du Régiment**, the opera I was a part of early 2019 at the MET, will be **streaming for free** this Monday June 29 from 7:30pm ET to June 30 at 6:30pm ET <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.metopera.org/season/on-demand/opera/?upc=810004201088" target="_blank">***at this link***</a>. By the way, here is the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.metopera.org/user-information/nightly-met-opera-streams/" target="_blank">***complete schedule***</a> of all the upcoming operas being streamed.

2) I was **selected at the Green Card lottery** this year, after 10 years of playing. However due to the latest <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/proclamation-suspending-entry-aliens-present-risk-u-s-labor-market-following-coronavirus-outbreak/" target="_blank">***Executive Order on Immigration***</a> (among many other factors that I will not mention here for the purpose of enjoying one's day), chances to actually get it this time are slimmer than other years. For example, the majority of people who were selected last year simply won't get it at this point. But hey, there's a chance!

In the meantime, I hope the second half of 2020 will slowly bring us everything that we wished for last New Year's Eve.

Much love,
