  Hey there, I've decided to make my website centered around a blog, to make it easier for me to publish, manage and share new content with <del>the world</del> you. It's a first, I'm very used to creating static websites, and it's always been a little frustrating for me not to be able to make them "live"!

Hey there,

I&#8217;ve decided to make my website centered around a blog, to make it easier for me to publish, manage and share new content with <del>the world</del> you. It&#8217;s a first, I&#8217;m used to creating static websites, and it&#8217;s always been a little frustrating for me not to be able to make them live! Plus the Internet now has some wonderful ways to help you create pretty cool stuff, so I just said &#8220;Yes!&#8221;.

I will be writing **the occasional &#8220;news&#8221; posts** to share what&#8217;s currently going on with my life, career, mentioning any successes or struggles, always in a valuable kind of way (I hope!)

I also have the idea of writing about **what happened today last year**, and comparing on a monthly basis the differences and/or similarities between what life was a year ago, and where it is at today (and hopefully engage the dialogue with you, and ask you to look back and share your own stories.) I keep a journal so I&#8217;ll make sure to be detailed enough!

Finally, I want to write about** **how **being aware of** **how we use technology could help us (re)connect to our creative selves.** May sound heavy, but it&#8217;s truly pretty cool!

I&#8217;m excited about this journey, feel free to share your comments and thoughts if you have any (and I obviously don&#8217;t expect the comment section to explode with this first post :) )

Until next time!
