Dear friends,

I hope the summer is going well and smoothly for you.

I just updated <a href="https://vimeo.com/136450987" target="_blank">my demo reel</a> after more than a year. Go take a look, and let me know what you think!

Finally, my ever-growing (and ever-awesome) friend and roommate Joseph Spinelli is performing in Edinburgh, Scotland in a <a href="http://www.broadwaybaby.com/shows/rent/706202" target="_blank">5-star reviewed</a> production of RENT. Go see it if you can. I did, I cried.

Much love.
