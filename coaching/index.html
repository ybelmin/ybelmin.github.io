<p><strong>Testimonials:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Yohan is terrific!  He is a natural teacher with a perfect ear.  I found him to be patient and encouraging with the ability to hone in on slight differences in intonation, resulting in a convincing portrayal.  I was going out of the role of a sneering World War I era European aristocrat when I hired him.  I got the part!</p></blockquote>
