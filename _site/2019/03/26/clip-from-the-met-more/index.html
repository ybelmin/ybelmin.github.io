<p>Here’s a little update from me since last January: </p>

<p>1) Here’s a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://vimeo.com/322529496" target="_blank">clip of my performance</a> in “La Fille du Régiment” @ the Met; <br />
2) Here is a fun <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://vimeo.com/322531429" target="_blank">time-lapse of the make-up process</a> to age me for the role of the Notary;<br />
3) + <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://operawire.com/metropolitan-opera-2018-19-review-la-fille-du-regiment/" target="_blank">my name was mentioned in a review</a> of the opera!</p>

<p>Finally, I’d like to give a shout-out to my good friend, former roommate AND former finalist of the Voice Switzerland, Rahel Buchhold. Alongside Rose Clark, they released their first EP <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/0R7LNvkzHdOvgzna8EEthI" target="_blank"><em>Blue Desert </em>on Spotify as the duet “Rahel n’ Rose”.</a></p>

<p>Here’s to Spring everyone, hope you’re doing well!</p>

<p>Much love,</p>

<p>-Yohan</p>
