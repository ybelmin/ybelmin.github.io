<p>Hi Everyone,</p>

<p>As you probably know, I had the chance to be part of the production of “Cendrillon” at the MET which closed on May 11. If you didn’t manage to see it, either at the opera or at the movies, I wanted to share with you <a href="https://vimeo.com/270187477" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>the clip of my appearance as the King’s Herald</strong></a>!</p>

<p>I am also now <strong>looking to be represented by an agent</strong>. If you happen to know a good one and are willing to introduce me to him/her, please shoot me an email, it would mean the world to me. I’ve realized over the years that all the best projects I’ve had the chance to be a part of have been the result of someone kind enough to recommend me. I believe it can be done again, and what goes around comes around!</p>

<p>Finally if you’re in NY tonight, check out <strong>Christian Felix’s and Shonali Bhowmik’s live podcast show <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/191127731610312/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“We Don’t Even Know”</a> at 8pm at Red Room</strong>, they’ve been working hard at it for years! Tonight’s guests are actor-comedian-writer Jon Benjamin (Bob’s Burgers, Archer), cartoonist-writer-performer Emily Flake Pastore and songwriter-musician Rob Townsend.</p>

<p>Much love,</p>

<p>-Yohan</p>
