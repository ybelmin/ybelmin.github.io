<p>Dear friends,</p>

<p>It is October, I am a year older and I have decided to make a new resolution and become proactive in my career! As I want to be better at staying in touch with you, I have decided to share quick periodic updates about my work that always include valuable information and recommendations.</p>

<p>So, after a busy summer, my favorite season has finally arrived and I am thrilled to share that I have updated the “Videos” section of my website! Please feel free to take a look at all the <a href="http://www.yohanbelmin.com/media/" target="_self">new videos of my work</a>.</p>

<p>And by the way, ever wondered what the percentage of people who achieve their New Year’s resolution is? Check out this very interesting <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/dandiamond/2013/01/01/just-8-of-people-achieve-their-new-years-resolutions-heres-how-they-did-it/" target="_blank">article</a> on Forbes’ website ;-)</p>

<p>I wish you a warm and happy fall.</p>
