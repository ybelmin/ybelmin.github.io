&lt;p&gt;It has been 2 years. Two years since I posted on this blog. I wasn’t prepared to write anything, really. I almost felt compelled to write a “Previously on &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Blog&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;”, but thought it would have been too much of Me Me Me, in a post that is already about Me Me Me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been rediscovering my life back home in France &amp;amp; realized it was sort of inevitable to have to start a little bit from scratch acting-wise. It was expected after all, I had moved back to be closer to my family knowing I would have to adjust professionally. And it has been just that. But now, I feel more compelled to come out of my shell and start reconnecting with the world!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since being back, I had a role on French TV, I acted in several short films, I continued recording voice-overs (I even was the French voice of Oscar ISAAC for a commercial) and I have been sending quite the pile of individual e-mails to people in the acting world stating that I exist. Good news: it appears I do. But it also appears I am not the only one doing it 😉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, happy to be back. If you are interested in what’s been new, &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://linktr.ee/yohanbelmin&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; style=&quot;color: #0000EE;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;my Linktree page&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;https://linktr.ee/yohanbelmin&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/a&gt; would be a great place to start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How have you been?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, lots of love, and of course, a happy happy (happy) new year,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you are finding the time to relax a little this summer (at the very least in spirit!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 12 formative years in NY, I have decided to move my home base to Paris, this October 1st. Priorities change over time and it now makes much more sense to me to be closer to my family. It has obviously been an unbelievable learning experience: I immersed myself in a new culture, I perfected a new language &amp;amp; I established myself as an artist. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being an immigrant made me more compassionate, and made me realize over the years that the country that I originally wanted to distance myself from, was bloody damn nice (pardon my Flemish): It’s beautiful, I speak the language, I can apply to any job that I want, I eat well, I drink well and I can complain and be accepted for it ;) &lt;em&gt;(by the way, I’m copyrighting the next self-help book about the “Power of Complaining”: it will be useless &lt;u&gt;AND&lt;/u&gt; a NYTimes Best Seller.)&lt;/em&gt; In all seriousness, France is home for me, and I am now ready to try home. And I still keep my US Artist Visa for potential work overseas. I will however now refuse my Green Card if I get it late September as I no longer seek permanent residency (the irony of it all!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But enough with me, how are you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much love, as always, and be merry!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very quick update to let you know that I am reprising the role of the “Herald” this holiday season in a new 95-minute &amp;amp; English version of &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://www.metopera.org/season/2021-22-season/cinderella/&quot; target=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Cinderella”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Jules Massenet, at the Metropolitan Opera. The show opens tonight, and will run until January 3, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My new Visa application has also been submitted yesterday, so hopefully I will get approved on time to be able to finish the run. I can’t remember ever asking for a Christmas / Hanukkah miracle, but today’s the day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wishing you all the best for this end of the year. I hope you are doing wonderfully well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much love, as always,&lt;/p&gt;

I really had nothing big to share since last January, hence the lack of updates. But things have changed recently:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) &lt;strong&gt;I have moved back to NY&lt;/strong&gt; 2 week ago. And yes, I had to do another 2-week quarantine outside of France to enter the US which, at this point, is just a nice vacation really. At least, the travel ban is now ending in November.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) &lt;strong&gt;I was able to join the Actors’ Equity Association (AEA)&lt;/strong&gt; thanks to their Open Access program + the fact that they now accept visa holders. I am excited to now have the opportunity to one day play French people on and off Broadway ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) &lt;strong&gt;I am looking for a long-term room to rent in NYC&lt;/strong&gt; (or, hey, an &lt;strong&gt;apartment?&lt;/strong&gt;). If any of you know of a great deal, or know someone who might, I am all ears. It would be starting Nov. 1, and the date is flexible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) &lt;strong&gt;I did not (yet) get my Green Card&lt;/strong&gt; even after winning the lottery, &lt;strong&gt;and I might not&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Briefly:&lt;/em&gt; there was a deadline after which you would lose your chance to get one + the embassies were closed and were not delivering visas for a long time due to Covid, &lt;em&gt;BUT&lt;/em&gt; 25,000 of us sued the US DoS and won, &lt;em&gt;HOWEVER&lt;/em&gt; the judge is only preserving a third of the Green Cards. &lt;em&gt;To sum up:&lt;/em&gt; fun times. Looking forward to Season 2!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) Which mean: &lt;strong&gt;I will most probably have to renew my Visa a 4th time for safety&lt;/strong&gt; in the upcoming months. I will once again need the help of some of you, and might reach out soon enough about this specific subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s for me, still holding on to wanting to live in the US for some unconscious and probably valid reason!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How about you? How has everything been with you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much love,&lt;/p&gt;

(I was tempted to create a survey with two possible choices: a) “Good, actually!” or b) “Duh…”.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my end, and I believe for a lot of people too, a lot has happened since I wrote in June. Let’s be honest: after doing a 2-week quarantine in Mexico in September, I managed to make it back to Texas to reunite with my partner, only to witness the relationship end quite quickly and move back to France. It’s sad, for sure, but I can’t help to see some humour in it too considering what 2020 has been in general + the fact that after re-reading my journal, my new year resolution for last year was to “travel and be more adventurous”! Hey, at least I am a man of my word ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for the (much) better part:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1)&lt;/strong&gt; I added a &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://www.yohanbelmin.com/voiceover/&quot; target=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;dedicated voice-over page&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on my website, and uploaded 3 VO demos.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2)&lt;/strong&gt; I now have a home studio set-up to record VO work.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;3)&lt;/strong&gt; And, I am now SAG-AFTRA Eligible thanks to a voice-over I recorded last year!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am thinking of you all, I hope you are well, and I am sending the brightest vibes your way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How is life? (for real.) I’d love to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much love,&lt;/p&gt;

I am currently back home in France waiting for the US border to reopen (at some point). I realize I haven’t sent any update in 10 months, but who said a newsletter had to be written more often than that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some recent news to share:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) &lt;strong&gt;La Fille Du Régiment&lt;/strong&gt;, the opera I was a part of early 2019 at the MET, will be &lt;strong&gt;streaming for free&lt;/strong&gt; this Monday June 29 from 7:30pm ET to June 30 at 6:30pm ET &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://www.metopera.org/season/on-demand/opera/?upc=810004201088&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;at this link&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. By the way, here is the &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://www.metopera.org/user-information/nightly-met-opera-streams/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;complete schedule&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of all the upcoming operas being streamed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) I was &lt;strong&gt;selected at the Green Card lottery&lt;/strong&gt; this year, after 10 years of playing. However due to the latest &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/proclamation-suspending-entry-aliens-present-risk-u-s-labor-market-following-coronavirus-outbreak/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Executive Order on Immigration&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (among many other factors that I will not mention here for the purpose of enjoying one’s day), chances to actually get it this time are slimmer than other years. For example, the majority of people who were selected last year simply won’t get it at this point. But hey, there’s a chance!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I hope the second half of 2020 will slowly bring us everything that we wished for last New Year’s Eve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much love,&lt;/p&gt;
