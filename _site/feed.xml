&lt;p&gt;1) Here’s a &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/322529496&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;clip of my performance&lt;/a&gt; in “La Fille du Régiment” @ the Met; 
2) Here is a fun &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/322531429&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;time-lapse of the make-up process&lt;/a&gt; to age me for the role of the Notary;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I’d like to give a shout-out to my good friend, former roommate AND former finalist of the Voice Switzerland, Rahel Buchhold. Alongside Rose Clark, they released their first EP &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/artist/0R7LNvkzHdOvgzna8EEthI&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blue Desert &lt;/em&gt;on Spotify as the duet “Rahel n’ Rose”.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s to Spring everyone, hope you’re doing well!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much love,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After spending 2 months on finalizing the renewal of my work Visa, and waiting on the answer, I can now focus on sharing all the good news:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) My &lt;strong&gt;work visa&lt;/strong&gt; got renewed for 3 more years.
2) An &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/rrcqlkbkqtltqxf/Journal%20du%20Vesinet.pdf?dl=0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;article was published&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about my recent work at the MET in “Le Journal du Vésinet”, the magazine of my hometown.
3) I voiced a French crow in the &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4laullxBFs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Brawl Stars” game app commercial&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
4) And finally, &lt;strong&gt;I got cast once again&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;at The Metropolitan Opera, this time in &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://www.metopera.org/season/2018-19-season/la-fille-du-regiment/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;La Fille du Régiment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in which I will be playing the role of the Notary starting Feb 7, opposite Kathleen Turner!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s to 2019!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much love to you all,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you probably know, I had the chance to be part of the production of “Cendrillon” at the MET which closed on May 11. If you didn’t manage to see it, either at the opera or at the movies, I wanted to share with you &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/270187477&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the clip of my appearance as the King’s Herald&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also now &lt;strong&gt;looking to be represented by an agent&lt;/strong&gt;. If you happen to know a good one and are willing to introduce me to him/her, please shoot me an email, it would mean the world to me. I’ve realized over the years that all the best projects I’ve had the chance to be a part of have been the result of someone kind enough to recommend me. I believe it can be done again, and what goes around comes around!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally if you’re in NY tonight, check out &lt;strong&gt;Christian Felix’s and Shonali Bhowmik’s live podcast show &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/events/191127731610312/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;“We Don’t Even Know”&lt;/a&gt; at 8pm at Red Room&lt;/strong&gt;, they’ve been working hard at it for years! Tonight’s guests are actor-comedian-writer Jon Benjamin (Bob’s Burgers, Archer), cartoonist-writer-performer Emily Flake Pastore and songwriter-musician Rob Townsend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much love,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stars kind of aligned big time and out of nowhere these past few months. The result is: I got cast as the Herald in “Cendrillon” @ the Metropolitan Opera which opens on April 12, for 8 performances over the span of 1 month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just to be clear: the Herald appears &lt;u&gt;very briefly&lt;/u&gt; at the end of the last Act to deliver a speech in French. So don’t even think of buying a ticket &lt;u&gt;just&lt;/u&gt; to see me on stage ;) However do consider coming for the incredible all-star cast of this production. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metopera.org/season/2017-18-season/cendrillon-massenet-tickets/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;All the info is available on the MET website&lt;/a&gt;. There will be, in addition, a live broadcast for the April 28 performance &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metopera.org/Season/In-Cinemas/Theater-Finder/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;in select movie theaters&lt;/a&gt; all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This couldn’t have happened on my own as you can imagine. I’d like to thank Arthur Lazalde who heard about the role and recommended me to the head of casting, Alba Quezada who prepared me incredibly well for the audition &amp;amp; callback, Bruce Baumer who recommended I contact Alba, Kevin Dyer – a great immigration lawyer – &amp;amp; Joseph Spinelli who helped me with legal advice, and yes, Preeti Gupta who recommended me to Kevin Dyer, I hear you, I hear you ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s all just super exciting when things like these happen. Thanks again for reading, I hope you’re doing well, and feel free to shoot me an email, I’d love to hear from you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much love,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope all is well with you, and you’re enjoying this hint of nostalgia surrounding every month of December (try listening to a classical piano playlist, and see what memories it brings up in you!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I’m happy to share that I’ve recorded &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/lz0svbl4aepjs4o/Getty%20Premium%20Access%20%20170817_FRFR.mp4?dl=0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a new VO for Getty Images&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; + &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/3e7k1x4pnqpm4ol/HIEX.mp4?dl=0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;another one for Holiday Inn Express&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, both in French. Having the opportunity to just be in a recording studio is something I’ve always dreamed of as a child, and I’m very grateful (yes, even after Thanksgiving) that I got to do it on a consistent basis this past year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pursuing this career in the US is not a necessarily easy ride for me, I often wonder if being far from the ones I love in France is sustainable in the long run or even if this career as a whole is sustainable in the long run. But it is these projects that remind me that, no matter how bumpy the ride may be, if you isolate all the good moments, ehhhh&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;it looks&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XadNMpvhkzA&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;…pretty…pretty good&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much love, and happy holidays ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope all has been going well with you these past few months. Here is a quick update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I currently am the French voice of the new “Violence Que Faire” campaign. “Violence Que Faire” is an association that actively helps prevent and end violence against women in Switzerland. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_uWTcnD2dw&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Here is the link to the Youtube Video&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;[Little disclaimer for French speakers: to be impactful, the dialogue is disturbing. Keep that in mind if you share it with other people!]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, my roommate and friend Joseph Spinelli is releasing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N8W68MR&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;his first EP on December 8&lt;/a&gt; and will be performing it live for the first time on Dec 14 @ The Bowery Electric, in NY. Come check it out if you’re around!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much love, and talk to you soon,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Yohan&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S.: If you’re interested in watching the original English version of the PSA, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oV_j_PM1bq4&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here the link to the video&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Yohan Belmin</name></author><summary type="html">I currently am the French voice of the new “Violence Que Faire” campaign. “Violence Que Faire” is an association that actively helps prevent and end violence against women in Switzerland.

&lt;p&gt;I first and foremost hope you are doing well…truly. You have been kind enough to read my newsletter/posts so far, some of you since I started writing them in 2013. Some of them were cheesy, some were good, some were a bit plain, but they were all part of a learning experience. I remember the anxiety I felt in my stomach the first time I hit “send”, my mind trying to rationalize the fact that I would probably be publicly bashed (I know, dramatic). But I survived, and it has been great ride so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I’ve always found it hard to go the extra mile, to truly put that fear of being judged aside, and share a more honest view on things, on what was going on. I found it more comfortable to play safe, even though it felt a bit off, much like that feeling of great disappointment when you start something you know will make you feel good, but stop short by fear of [&lt;em&gt;insert your fear here&lt;/em&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My 2016 resolution was to accept to be more vulnerable, which came to me after reading the very thoughtful “Daring Greatly” by Brené Brown. One sentence really resonated: “I can honestly say that nothing is as uncomfortable, dangerous and hurtful as believing that I’m standing on the outside of my life looking in and wondering what it would be like if I had the courage to show up and let myself be seen.” So this time, and instead of once again only showing the surface of my thoughts, here is what I have to say this month:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My name is Yohan, born Yohann (typo on my birth certificate), I’m almost 30, I’m currently a bit clueless about what my immediate future will look like, I’m in a relationship with acting and we’re working on it the best we can, I have a strong faith I’ll achieve great things yet have no real idea how I’m going to get there, I’m gay and to this day still feel a weight in my chest when talking about it, and finally I’m a little discouraged not to have access to great work in a country that I truly love because I don’t yet possess a Card that is Green. That is what is going on with me today. And it’s not a big deal, it’s just the truth. Because “in the end, you’re sitting on a planet spinning around in the middle of nowhere. Things are going to happen anyway. If you have to be here, at least be happy and enjoy the experience.” ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, thanks for reading, have the most amazing day ever, much love and happiness to you all, and enough about me. How are you doing? What’s up with you? How’s life? I’d love to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m looking for a job!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m back in NY after completing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lewagon.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“Le Wagon”&lt;/a&gt; in Paris, and I’m a looking for a position as a &lt;strong&gt;“Junior Full Stack Ruby Developer”&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;If you happen to know of a company (or a team) &lt;/strong&gt;looking for an extra pair of hands in the web development world, &lt;strong&gt;please shoot me a message&lt;/strong&gt;, it would help me tremendously and it would mean the world to me! &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/ybelmin&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’ve revamped my LinkedIn Profile&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; where everything is nicely presented and explained!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s an exciting transition, I came to realize over the years that there is more to me than solely an artistic career, I’ve always loved (and still love) mathematics and I truly intend to make the most of it! I’m excited to see what this mix of art and science will lead up to!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope you’re doing well and enjoying the warmer days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m still back home, finishing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lewagon.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Le Wagon&lt;/a&gt; in 3 weeks. As a final project, 2 of my fellow students and I will be creating a &lt;strong&gt;web app themed around the Paleo Diet&lt;/strong&gt;. More about it once it’s in the making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But on the subject of dietary lifestyles, I really want to share &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nadkmy4nE_c&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a video of a constructive debate around food&lt;/a&gt; that I find really enlightening. It’s, to me, one of those rare valuable videos you can find on the Internet. It is a perfect example that food works differently on different people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sending you much love and talk to you soon,&lt;/p&gt;
