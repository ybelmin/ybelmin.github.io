<p>Hey there,</p>

<p>I’ve decided to make my website centered around a blog, to make it easier for me to publish, manage and share new content with <del>the world</del> you. It’s a first, I’m used to creating static websites, and it’s always been a little frustrating for me not to be able to make them live! Plus the Internet now has some wonderful ways to help you create pretty cool stuff, so I just said “Yes!”.</p>

<p>I will be writing <strong>the occasional “news” posts</strong> to share what’s currently going on with my life, career, mentioning any successes or struggles, always in a valuable kind of way (I hope!)</p>

<p>I also have the idea of writing about <strong>what happened today last year</strong>, and comparing on a monthly basis the differences and/or similarities between what life was a year ago, and where it is at today (and hopefully engage the dialogue with you, and ask you to look back and share your own stories.) I keep a journal so I’ll make sure to be detailed enough!</p>

<p>Finally, I want to write about<strong> </strong>how <strong>being aware of</strong> <strong>how we use technology could help us (re)connect to our creative selves.</strong> May sound heavy, but it’s truly pretty cool!</p>

<p>I’m excited about this journey, feel free to share your comments and thoughts if you have any (and I obviously don’t expect the comment section to explode with this first post :) )</p>

<p>Until next time!</p>
