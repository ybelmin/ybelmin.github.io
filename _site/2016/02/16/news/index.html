<p>Dear friends,</p>

<p>Things are going well, slowly and surely.</p>

<p>My visa renewal got approved and I just got back to New York. Three more years of being able to work here is always a pretty cool and relieving news to get, believe me! Thanks again to everyone who helped me in the process, it means a whole lot to me. And I’m entering a bit of a transitional year as well so that’s going to be interesting to follow too.</p>

<p>Finally, I want to say a huge congrats to Caycee Black and Jeffrey Turboff <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BAoP3LYBHLs/" target="_blank">for their win</a> at the Macabre Faire Film Festival for “Jimbo”, you go guys! ;)</p>

<p>Much love and talk to you soon.</p>
