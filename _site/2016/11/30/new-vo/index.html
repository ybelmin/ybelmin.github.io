<p>Dear friends,</p>

<p>I hope all has been going well with you these past few months. Here is a quick update.</p>

<p>I currently am the French voice of the new “Violence Que Faire” campaign. “Violence Que Faire” is an association that actively helps prevent and end violence against women in Switzerland. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_uWTcnD2dw" target="_blank">Here is the link to the Youtube Video</a>. <em>[Little disclaimer for French speakers: to be impactful, the dialogue is disturbing. Keep that in mind if you share it with other people!]</em></p>

<p>Finally, my roommate and friend Joseph Spinelli is releasing <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N8W68MR" target="_blank">his first EP on December 8</a> and will be performing it live for the first time on Dec 14 @ The Bowery Electric, in NY. Come check it out if you’re around!</p>

<p>Much love, and talk to you soon,</p>

<p>-Yohan</p>
