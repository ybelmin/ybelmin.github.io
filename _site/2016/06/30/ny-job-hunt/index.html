<p>Hi everyone,</p>

<p>I’m looking for a job!</p>

<p>I’m back in NY after completing <a href="https://www.lewagon.com/" target="_blank">“Le Wagon”</a> in Paris, and I’m a looking for a position as a <strong>“Junior Full Stack Ruby Developer”</strong>. <strong>If you happen to know of a company (or a team) </strong>looking for an extra pair of hands in the web development world, <strong>please shoot me a message</strong>, it would help me tremendously and it would mean the world to me! <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ybelmin" target="_blank"><strong>I’ve revamped my LinkedIn Profile</strong></a> where everything is nicely presented and explained!</p>

<p>It’s an exciting transition, I came to realize over the years that there is more to me than solely an artistic career, I’ve always loved (and still love) mathematics and I truly intend to make the most of it! I’m excited to see what this mix of art and science will lead up to!</p>

<p>I’m sending you much love, I hope all is well with you and thank you again for reading,</p>

<p>-Yohan</p>
