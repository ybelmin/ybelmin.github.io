<p>Hey everyone,</p>

<p>Guess what, <strong>I’m back home for Spring</strong> for the first time in 6 years. And I know this comes as a relief to you as you were probably wondering day and night about where I was ;)</p>

<p>I actually decided to come back to follow a <strong>9-week computer programming course in Paris</strong> called <a href="https://www.lewagon.com/" target="_blank">Le Wagon</a>. Why? Because I’ve always liked it, and I want to add a more <strong>rational set of skills to my career</strong>. Also I get to spend time with my family and eat my Mom’s cooking for a while, not gonna lie!</p>

<p>And while I’m here, <strong>Flo Ankah</strong> is preparing her very French <a href="http://www.broadwayworld.com/cabaret/article/French-Singer-Floanne-to-Bring-APRIL-IN-PARIS-to-Feinsteins54-Below-20160407" target="_blank">“April in Paris”</a> concert at <strong>Feinstein’s/54 Below</strong> on April 22. Go support her and get a taste of Parisian Spring in NY!</p>

<p>Much love and talk to you soon,</p>

<p>-Yohan</p>
