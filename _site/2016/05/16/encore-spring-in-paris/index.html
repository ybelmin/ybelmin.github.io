<p>Hey everyone,</p>

<p>Hope you’re doing well and enjoying the warmer days.</p>

<p>I’m still back home, finishing <a href="https://www.lewagon.com/" target="_blank">Le Wagon</a> in 3 weeks. As a final project, 2 of my fellow students and I will be creating a <strong>web app themed around the Paleo Diet</strong>. More about it once it’s in the making.</p>

<p>But on the subject of dietary lifestyles, I really want to share <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nadkmy4nE_c" target="_blank">a video of a constructive debate around food</a> that I find really enlightening. It’s, to me, one of those rare valuable videos you can find on the Internet. It is a perfect example that food works differently on different people.</p>

<p>Sending you much love and talk to you soon,</p>

<p>-Yohan</p>
