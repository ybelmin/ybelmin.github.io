<p>Dear friends,</p>

<p>Great things happening, once again, slowly but surely.</p>

<p>Check out <a href="https://vimeo.com/125959966" target="_blank"><strong>one of the readings</strong></a> I did for Meghan Rafferty, as part of a 4-week class I took with her.</p>

<p>And if you can, I highly recommend seeing <a href="http://labtheater.org/events/nice-girl/" target="_blank"><strong>“Nice Girl”</strong></a> at <strong>the Labyrinth Theater</strong>. There’s nothing like witnessing great acting on stage.</p>

<p>Enjoy Spring!</p>
