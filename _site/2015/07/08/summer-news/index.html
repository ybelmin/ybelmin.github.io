<p>I took a break from giving updates last month, it surprisingly felt good.</p>

<p>I have been happy to be working more consistently thanks to the trust that several companies and people put in me. At this time, mentioning a specific project would not do honor to the other ones, but when I now imagine my tomorrow I can see myself contributing differently to the profession than just wholly being a performer. I am very grateful for all the people who are making it possible for me to pursue my goal.</p>

<p>And as every year, I encourage you to discover the new edition of the <a href="http://chelseafilm.org/" target="_blank">Chelsea Film Festival</a>. Ingrid and Sonia Jean-Baptiste have done an incredible job creating and organizing it for the past two years. You still have until August 15th to submit your film!</p>

<p>Much love.</p>
