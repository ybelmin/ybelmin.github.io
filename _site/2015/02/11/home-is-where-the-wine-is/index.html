<p>Dear friends,</p>

<p>I’m loving Paris for another month before coming back to NY on March 1st. It would have been the longest time I’ve spent back home in 5 years, and it just feels right.</p>

<p>I’m glad to share that the movie <strong>ALLURE directed by Vladan Nikolic</strong>, in which I appear, will be <a href="http://www.allurethefilm.com/" target="_blank"><strong>opening in NY on March 6 at the Quad Cinema</strong></a>, and will run until March 12. I will of course be present and I want you to go see it too! I mean, you have the choice, but that’d be very honorable of you to do so ;)</p>

<p>Finally, this month, I’d like to recommend to you an inspiring <strong>speech coach</strong>. It’s <strong>Monica Blaze Leavitt</strong>. She has been teaching voice, diction and accent reduction for almost 20 years, and has made my speech improve incredibly ever since we started working together. <a href="http://theprofessionalimpact.com/monica-blaze-leavitt/" target="_blank"><strong>Here’s more about her</strong></a>, and you should definitely check her out!</p>

<p>Be well and see you soon!</p>
