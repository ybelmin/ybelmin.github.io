<p>Dear friends,</p>

<p>I hope the summer is going well and smoothly for you.</p>

<p>I just updated <a href="https://vimeo.com/136450987" target="_blank">my demo reel</a> after more than a year. Go take a look, and let me know what you think!</p>

<p>Finally, my ever-growing (and ever-awesome) friend and roommate Joseph Spinelli is performing in Edinburgh, Scotland in a <a href="http://www.broadwaybaby.com/shows/rent/706202" target="_blank">5-star reviewed</a> production of RENT. Go see it if you can. I did, I cried.</p>

<p>Much love.</p>
