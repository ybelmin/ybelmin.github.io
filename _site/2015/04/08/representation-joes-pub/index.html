<p>Dear friends,</p>

<p>Just a quick email from me, as this new month begins.</p>

<p>I’m glad to say that I started <strong>freelancing</strong> with Sandy Gunar from <strong>Avanti Talent Management</strong>. Still moving forward and getting better exposure, one step at a time.</p>

<p>And most importantly my roommate <strong>Joseph Spinelli</strong> will be singing at <strong>Joe’s Pub</strong> on Sunday night as part of <a href="http://www.playbill.com/news/article/anthony-rapp-will-get-back-to-paying-the-rent-this-month-345879#.VR7Pas_XE8A.facebook" target="_blank">Paying the RENT!</a> with <strong>Anthony Rapp</strong> and other great Broadway names. This concert will be a fundraising for their upcoming production of RENT at the <strong>2015 Edinburgh Fringe</strong>. Promo code for Sunday is <strong>RENT12</strong>. You’re welcome ;)</p>

<p>Be well and see you soon!</p>
