<p>Dear friends,</p>

<p>I’ve never asked for help via this newsletter, but here it is, I have faith something good will come out of it.</p>

<p>I’m renewing my work Visa for 3 more years. If anyone can &amp; is willing to:<br />
<strong>   =&gt; </strong>include me in a <strong><u>potential</u></strong> project between now and late 2018;<br />
<strong>   =&gt; </strong>employ me on an <strong><u>ongoing</u></strong> basis;<br />
<strong>   =&gt; </strong>or <strong><u>feature</u></strong> me in an article or blog;<br />
I’d be forever grateful. I now more than ever need all the love I can get.</p>

<p>I hope you’re well and you had an amazing summer,</p>

<p>Much love.</p>
