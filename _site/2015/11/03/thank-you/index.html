<p>Dear friends,</p>

<p>I want to thank all of you for your kind words, support and tremendous help regarding my Visa application, we managed to send a solid file on time, last Friday. Now all there is to do is wait for the (of course positive) answer in a couple of months.</p>

<p>Thank you once again so much, I am grateful beyond measures to be surrounded, physically and virtually, by such caring and loving people.</p>

<p>Finally, my good friend Myriam Phiro is doing her “54 Below” debut this Thursday Nov 5, in <a href="http://54below.com/artist/myriam-phiro-edith-piaf-at-100/" target="_blank">“Edith Piaf at 100”</a>. She’s even featured on <a href="https://www.groupon.com/deals/campaign-0-39654563" target="_blank">Groupon</a>! Break a leg Myriam :)</p>

<p>Much love to you all.</p>
