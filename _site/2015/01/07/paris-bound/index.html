<p>Dear friends,</p>

<p>First and foremost, of course, happy new year for the 1000th time ;) I don’t know about you but I have a good feeling about this one, as I had with 2014, 2013 and 2011. (2012 was such a bummer, wasn’t it?)</p>

<p>This January celebrates my 5-year anniversary in New York, and what a better place to celebrate it than… Paris. “Whaaat?” do I already hear in the audience? Yes (and for the love of me please sit down) I’ve decided to extend my stay to spend some quality time with my beloved ones + start building the foundations of my acting career “en français” as well. I have a good feeling about this, as I had with… ok, ok, I get it.</p>

<p>You want a good resolution? Keep a journal this year. Here is <a href="http://lifehacker.com/why-you-should-keep-a-journal-and-how-to-start-yours-1547057185" target="_blank">why</a>, and here is <a href="http://dayoneapp.com/" target="_blank">how</a> to conveniently do it. And rest assured, no one said it had to be daily!</p>

<p>Be well!</p>
