<p>Hey everyone,</p>

<p>I hope all is well with you, and you’re enjoying this hint of nostalgia surrounding every month of December (try listening to a classical piano playlist, and see what memories it brings up in you!)</p>

<p>Today, I’m happy to share that I’ve recorded <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/lz0svbl4aepjs4o/Getty%20Premium%20Access%20%20170817_FRFR.mp4?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>a new VO for Getty Images</strong></a> + <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/3e7k1x4pnqpm4ol/HIEX.mp4?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>another one for Holiday Inn Express</strong></a>, both in French. Having the opportunity to just be in a recording studio is something I’ve always dreamed of as a child, and I’m very grateful (yes, even after Thanksgiving) that I got to do it on a consistent basis this past year.</p>

<p>Pursuing this career in the US is not a necessarily easy ride for me, I often wonder if being far from the ones I love in France is sustainable in the long run or even if this career as a whole is sustainable in the long run. But it is these projects that remind me that, no matter how bumpy the ride may be, if you isolate all the good moments, ehhhh<strong> </strong>it looks<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XadNMpvhkzA" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>…pretty…pretty good</strong></a>.</p>

<p>Much love, and happy holidays ;)</p>
