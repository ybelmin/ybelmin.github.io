<p>Dear friends,</p>

<p>So what’s new you are (not) asking me? ;-)</p>

<p>I have recorded a voice-over in French for Adidas this past month. Come <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfXMErJpxYQ" target="_blank">take a look</a> at the commercial on Youtube!</p>

<p>And if you haven’t already, go see <a href="http://blog.3ldnyc.org/post/70512249867/deepest-man-written-by-james-scruggs-directed-by" target="_blank">“Deepest Man”</a> at the 3LD Theatre. It’s a holographic play about Hurricane Katrina. It runs until June 14, it is a “visual marvel” according to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/31/theater/in-deepest-man-an-immersion-into-a-watery-beyond.html?_r=0" target="_blank">the NYTimes</a> and my talented friend Miguel Reis is in it!</p>

<p>Be well!</p>
