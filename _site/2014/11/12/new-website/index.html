<p>Dear friends,</p>

<p>I have been working hard this month, despite what my inner little New York voice is trying to tell me!</p>

<p>My new website is on (UPDATE: I was talking about the previous one!) I would love to hear your feedback, it’d help me make it even better, for me, and soon for others (hint hint) ;-)</p>

<p>Finally, and this might be the first time I’m recommending a book before actually devouring it, my instinct tells me that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Powers-Two-Finding-Innovation-Creative/dp/0544031598" target="_blank">this book</a> is going to be a game-changing read.</p>

<p>Stay warm!</p>
