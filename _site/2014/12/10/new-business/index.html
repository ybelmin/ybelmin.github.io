<p>Dear friends,</p>

<p>I stuck to it. I set myself a three-month goal, and the result is here.</p>

<p>I’m proud, happy and relieved (not gonna lie!) to present to you MyActorTemplate.com (UPDATE: It’s on hold, the business model wasn’t working, I have a new idea in mind). This officially makes me an actor who creates websites for actors, and I like the idea of it! I put a lot of thought and work into it, so feel free to spread the love!</p>

<p>And of course, who isn’t behind Cumberbatch for the Oscars – if you haven’t seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5CjKEFb-sM&amp;safe=active" target="_blank">The Imitation Game</a>, you should probably run for your life and see it.</p>

<p>Happy holidays!</p>
