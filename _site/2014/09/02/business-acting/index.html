<p>Dear friends,</p>

<p>I hope you had the chance to take a well-deserved break in August and that you are all fresh and ready to take “September” by the horns!</p>

<p>I’ve spent my summer re-assessing my wants and my needs about my life and career goals. I has been a very enlightening process and, yes, one hell of a mental ride! Conclusion? I have an office and I’m creating my first business on top of a very specific vision I now have for my acting career. More about it next month!</p>

<p>Finally, I’d like to recommend to you a classic, if not the reference, in terms of personal development and self-help book: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Think-Grow-Rich-Napoleon-Hill/dp/1604591870/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1409674787&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=think+and+grow+rich" target="_blank">“Think and Grow Rich”</a> by Napoleon Hill. As with everything, it’s not for everyone, but I believe it’s a least worth peeking into it.</p>

<p>Be well, and let’s get to work!</p>
