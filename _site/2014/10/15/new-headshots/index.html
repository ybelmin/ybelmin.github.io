<p>Dear friends,</p>

<p>What a cool thing it is to notice progress in your everyday life, things don’t always go smoothly but knowing you’re going in the right direction makes it exciting to keep rolling and see what’s going to happen!</p>

<p>I recently took new headshots and they are pretty awesome. It’s all thanks to the amazing work of Dave Thomas Brown. Feel free to take a look at them <a href="http://www.yohanbelmin.com/photos/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, I’d like to recommend to you a very compelling <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-science-of-getting-rich/?dtcode=aowePVc1G1oP" target="_blank">online course</a> on the book “The Science of Getting Rich” by Wallace D. Wattle. Don’t be fooled by the title, it has much more knowledge to it than what the simplistic headline could imply. And please don’t pay the full price, search Google for a <a href="http://www.retailmenot.com/view/udemy.com?c=6240502" target="_blank">coupon</a> ;)</p>

<p>Be well!</p>
