<p>Dear friends,</p>

<p>Forcing yourself to take risks on a regular basis does feel amazing. But I haven’t been that mentally exhausted and challenged since I had to switch from French to English when I moved here 4 years ago!</p>

<p>Last month, as part of the Career Mastery course I am following, I tried to get in touch with Jodie Foster to ask her questions about her career. The best advice I got was a warm “I don’t count my failures. Only the victories. Hope that helps.” from her agent’s assistant. Hey, I’ll take it!</p>

<p>Finally, I’d like to give a huge shout-out to my friend and former roommie Rahel Buchhold who got selected for the Swiss version of The Voice! You can check her <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhCX83h9A7s" target="_blank">first performance here</a>, and her <a href="https://www.facebook.com/RahelBuchholdOfficial" target="_blank">Fan Page</a> here! Go Rahel!!</p>

<p>Be well!</p>
