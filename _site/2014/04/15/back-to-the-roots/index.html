<p>Finally, I’d like to give (another!) huge shout-out to my friend Rahel Buchhold who made it to the final round of The Voice in the Switzerland! Check out one of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX7MFYXcPDM" target="_blank">her duets here</a> (she’s on the left), Rahel for the win!</p>

<p>Be well!</p>
