<p>Dear friends,</p>

<p>Life is positive, I am starting to realize what path I truly want to follow, life-wise and acting-wise. I have been spending the beginning of my summer writing, reading and brainstorming and it has been bringing me serenity and focus. I feel I am transitioning into a new era of my blooming existence and I am sensing it is for the better.</p>

<p>I have recently been part of an imaginative showcase with Casting Director Mia Cusumano, thoughtfully organized by my inspirational teacher <a href="http://www.bobmcandrew.com/" target="_blank">Bob McAndrew</a>. Having the opportunity to work on this common project with like-minded actors/friends has reminded me how much you can achieve when you are moving as a team.</p>

<p>Finally, and this just might have been what triggered my change of perspective, I would like to recommend to you <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Slight-Edge-Disciplines-Happiness/dp/1626340463" target="_blank">“The Slight Edge”</a> by Jeff Olson. I found it to be different from all the other “Success” books that I’ve read. Instead of a magic formula, it teaches you the power of discipline.</p>

<p>Be well and have a great summer.</p>
